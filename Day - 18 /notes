 📘 Day 18 – Networking Fundamentals (Cloud Perspective)

 1️⃣ What is Networking

→ Networking ka matlab hota hai multiple devices ko connect karna taaki wo data share kar saken
→ Devices ho sakte hain computers, servers, mobiles, routers, switches

→ Simple example
Laptop → Router → Internet → Server

→ Cloud me networking ka role
User aur cloud resources (EC2, S3, DB) ke beech communication enable karta hai

---

 2️⃣ How Network Works (Basic Flow)

→ Sender device data ko packets me todta hai
→ Packets network ke through travel karte hain
→ Router aur switches packets ko forward karte hain
→ Receiver device packets ko reassemble karta hai

→ Cloud example
User browser → Internet → AWS Network → EC2 Server → Response back to user

---

 3️⃣ History of Internet (Short & Simple)

→ 1960s → ARPANET (US Defense project)
→ Purpose → Reliable communication during failures
→ 1980s → TCP/IP standard bana
→ 1990s → World Wide Web (WWW) aaya
→ 2000s → Internet commercial hua
→ Present → Cloud computing, streaming, AI, IoT

→ Cloud ka base
Internet hi cloud services ka backbone hai

---

 4️⃣ Why Networking is Important

→ Data sharing possible hoti hai
→ Remote access milta hai
→ Cloud services globally accessible hoti hain
→ Security policies apply hoti hain
→ Scalability aur performance improve hoti hai

→ Cloud me
Without networking → EC2, S3, databases access nahi ho sakte

 5️⃣ Types of Network

---

 🔹 LAN (Local Area Network)

→ Small area me devices connect karta hai
→ Office, home, lab network

→ Example
Office ke computers ek router se connected

→ Cloud relation
Private network jaisa concept VPC ke andar use hota hai

---

 🔹 WAN (Wide Area Network)

→ Large geographical area cover karta hai
→ Cities, countries, continents

→ Example
Internet

→ Cloud relation
AWS regions aur users WAN ke through connect hote hain

---

 🔹 MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

→ City-level network
→ LAN se bada, WAN se chhota

→ Example
City-wide ISP network

→ Cloud relation
Regional connectivity ke liye useful

---

 🔹 PAN (Personal Area Network)

→ Very small range
→ Personal devices ke beech

→ Example
Mobile → Bluetooth → Earbuds

→ Cloud relation
End-user devices jo cloud services access karte hain

---

 6️⃣ Networking in Cloud (High-Level View)

→ Cloud provider apna global network maintain karta hai
→ Users internet ke through cloud se connect hote hain
→ Virtual networks (VPC) banaye jaate hain
→ Subnets, routing, security rules apply hote hain

→ Result
Secure, scalable, highly available communication

---

 7️⃣ Real-Life Example (Cloud Context)

→ User opens website
→ Request goes through LAN → ISP → WAN (Internet)
→ Reaches AWS data center
→ Routed to EC2 instance
→ Response travels back same path

---

 🔑 Key Learnings – Day 18

→ Networking = Device communication
→ Internet = Backbone of cloud computing
→ Data packets ke form me travel karta hai
→ Networking cloud access aur security dono ke liye critical hai
→ LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN different scale ke networks hain
