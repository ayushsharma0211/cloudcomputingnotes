📘 Day 24 – Security in Cloud (AWS Perspective)

1️⃣ What is Cloud Security?

Cloud security ka matlab hota hai:
→ Data
→ Applications
→ Infrastructure
→ Access

ko unauthorized access, attacks, data loss se protect karna.

👉 Cloud me security sirf AWS ka kaam nahi hota, customer ka bhi hota hai.

---

 2️⃣ Shared Responsibility Model (Most Important Concept)

AWS cloud security Shared Responsibility Model follow karta hai.

👉 Simple rule:

> AWS = Security “OF” the Cloud
> Customer = Security “IN” the Cloud

---

 3️⃣ Real-World Example (Building / Society Example)

 🏢 Building Management (AWS Responsibility)

→ Gate
→ CCTV camera
→ Lift
→ Fire safety
→ Building structure

AWS bhi same kaam karta hai 👇

→ Data center security
→ Physical servers
→ Network cables
→ Power, cooling
→ Hardware protection

---

 🧑 Flat Owner / Tenant (Customer Responsibility)

→ Flat ka lock
→ Keys sambhalna
→ Door band rakhna
→ Apna data safe rakhna

Customer ke cloud responsibilities 👇

→ OS configuration
→ Firewall rules
→ IAM users & permissions
→ Data encryption
→ Application security

---

 4️⃣ AWS Responsibility – Security OF the Cloud

AWS in cheezon ka 100% responsible hota hai:

→ Physical data centers
→ Hardware (servers, storage, networking)
→ Region, Availability Zone, Edge locations
→ Underlying cloud infrastructure
→ Managed services ka base layer

📌 Example:
→ EC2 server physically kaha rakha hai
→ Disk ka hardware failure
→ Data center me fire, flood, power backup

👉 Customer ko ye sab dekhna hi nahi padta

---

 5️⃣ Customer Responsibility – Security IN the Cloud

Customer ko in cheezon ka dhyaan rakhna hota hai:

→ EC2 OS (Linux/Windows) hardening
→ Security Groups (firewall rules)
→ IAM users, roles, policies
→ Application security
→ Database passwords
→ Data encryption
→ Backup & monitoring

📌 Example:
→ Port 22 open karna ya band rakhna
→ Strong password use karna
→ Root user ka misuse na ho
→ Public bucket accidentally na ban jaaye

---

 6️⃣ Service Type ke According Responsibility

 🖥️ IaaS (EC2, EBS, VPC)

AWS:
→ Physical infra
→ Hypervisor

Customer:
→ OS
→ Firewall
→ Patching
→ App security

---

 🛠️ PaaS (RDS, Lambda)

AWS:
→ OS
→ Database engine
→ Infrastructure

Customer:
→ DB access
→ Query security
→ IAM permissions

---

 ☁️ SaaS (Gmail, Office 365)

AWS / Provider:
→ Almost everything

Customer:
→ User access
→ Passwords
→ Data usage

---

 7️⃣ IAM (Identity and Access Management)

IAM = Who can do what in AWS

→ User: Person
→ Role: Service / temporary access
→ Policy: Permission rules

📌 Real-world:
→ Office ID card system
→ Kis employee ko kaunsa access milega

AWS Example:
→ EC2 ko S3 access dena (IAM Role)
→ Developer ko sirf read access dena

---

 8️⃣ API Security

API = Application Programming Interface
→ AWS services APIs ke through communicate karti hain

Security points:
→ IAM authentication
→ HTTPS mandatory
→ Access keys protect karna

📌 Example:
→ AWS CLI
→ SDK calls
→ Terraform

---

 9️⃣ Monolithic vs Microservices (Security Angle)

 Monolithic App

→ Ek hi big application
→ Ek issue = poori app down
→ Security risk zyada

 Microservices

→ Small independent services
→ Limited blast radius
→ Better isolation
→ Easy to secure

AWS Example:
→ ALB + multiple EC2 / Lambda services

---

 🔐 Security Golden Rules (Interview Ready)

→ Never use root user daily work ke liye
→ Always follow least privilege
→ Encrypt data at rest & in transit
→ Close unused ports
→ Enable logging (CloudTrail, CloudWatch)
→ Backup is also security

---

 ✅ Day 24 Summary

→ Cloud security is a shared responsibility
→ AWS secures the cloud infrastructure
→ Customer secures data, access, and applications
→ IAM is the backbone of AWS security
→ Misconfiguration = biggest security risk

📌 Most important line (Interview):

> AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud,
> Customer is responsible for security IN the cloud.
