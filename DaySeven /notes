 ☁️ Day 7 – Cloud Storage (Detailed + Real-Life Examples)

---

 🧱 1. Block Storage

 ✅ Definition

Block Storage ek aisa storage hota hai jisme data ko chhote-chhote fixed size blocks me divide karke store kiya jata hai.
Har block ka apna unique address hota hai.

👉 System blocks ko jod kar file banata hai.

---

 🧠 Real-Life Example

 Computer ki internal hard disk (C: Drive)
 Mobile phone ka internal storage

OS ko pata hota hai kaunsa block kahan rakha hai.

---

 🔍 Deep Understanding

 Block storage directly OS ke saath attach hota hai
 OS decide karta hai:

   File system (NTFS, ext4, etc.)
   Data ka structure
 Isliye performance bahut fast hoti hai

---

 🎯 Where Block Storage is Used

 Operating System install karna
 Databases (MySQL, Oracle)
 High-performance applications

---

 ☁️ AWS Block Storage → EBS (Elastic Block Store)

 🔹 What is EBS?

EBS ek virtual hard disk hai jo EC2 ke saath attach hoti hai.

📌 Example:

 EC2 = CPU
 EBS = Hard disk

Agar EC2 stop ho jaye, data EBS me safe rehta hai.

---

 📁 2. File Storage

 ✅ Definition

File Storage me data files aur folders ke form me store hota hai, jise multiple users ya systems access kar sakte hain.

---

 🧠 Real-Life Example

 Office ka shared folder
 Google Drive
 Pen drive jise multiple log use karte hain

---

 🔍 Deep Understanding

 File system already bana hota hai
 User directly files ke saath kaam karta hai
 Sharing aur collaboration easy hota hai

---

 🎯 Where File Storage is Used

 Shared documents
 Website files (HTML, CSS, images)
 Media processing

---

 ☁️ AWS File Storage → EFS (Elastic File System)

 🔹 What is EFS?

EFS ek managed file system hai jo:

 Multiple EC2 instances ke saath attach hota hai

📌 Example:

 3 EC2 servers ek hi website chala rahe hain
 Sab EFS se same files read/write kar rahe hain

---

 🪣 3. Object Storage

 ✅ Definition

Object Storage me data objects ke form me store hota hai.
Har object ke paas hota hai:

 Data
 Metadata
 Unique ID

👉 Ye traditional folder system follow nahi karta.

---

 🧠 Real-Life Example

 Google Photos
 YouTube videos
 WhatsApp media backup

Tum file ka location ya block nahi jante, sirf object name jante ho.

---

 🔍 Deep Understanding

 Object storage highly scalable hota hai
 Internet ke through access hota hai
 File system jaise operations (rename, move) limited hote hain

---

 🎯 Where Object Storage is Used

 Images, videos
 Backups
 Logs
 Static websites

---

 ☁️ AWS Object Storage → S3 (Simple Storage Service)

 🔹 What is S3?

S3 AWS ka object storage service hai jisme data buckets me store hota hai.

📌 Example:

 Netflix videos
 Website images
 Backup files

S3 ka durability hota hai 99.999999999% (11 9s).

 🔄 Block vs File vs Object (Deep Comparison)

| Feature        | Block     | File          | Object    |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Data Structure | Blocks    | Files/Folders | Objects   |
| Performance    | Very High | Medium        | High      |
| Scalability    | Limited   | Medium        | Very High |
| Sharing        | No        | Yes           | Yes       |
| AWS Service    | EBS       | EFS           | S3        |

---

 🧠 Real-World Scenario (Easy to Remember)

🏠 House Example

 Block Storage → Almirah ke drawers
 File Storage → Shared cupboard
 Object Storage → Godown with labels

---

 ✅ One-Line Definitions (Exam Ready)

 Block Storage → Disk-level storage
 File Storage → Shared file system
 Object Storage → Metadata-based storage

---

 🎯 AWS Use Summary

 EBS → EC2 OS & database
 EFS → Shared website files
 S3 → Images, videos, backups
