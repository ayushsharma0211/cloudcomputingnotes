☁️ DAY 13 – Amazon S3 (Complete Hands-On Notes)

👉 “Today I completed Amazon S3 with full hands-on practice.”

---

 📌 1. What is Amazon S3?

 ✅ Definition

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) ek object-based cloud storage service hai jahan:

 Data Bucket ke andar store hota hai
 Har file ko Object bola jata hai
 Highly durable (99.999999999%), scalable aur secure hota hai

---

 🧠 Real-Life Example

Google Drive / OneDrive jaise — lekin enterprise level par.

---

 🪣 2. S3 Bucket & Objects

 🔹 Bucket

 Top-level container hota hai
 Region specific hota hai
 Name globally unique hona chahiye

 🔹 Object

 Actual file (image, video, pdf, backup, logs)
 Object = File + Metadata + Permissions

---

 ⚙️ 3. Bucket Creation (Hands-On)

 Steps:

1. AWS Console login
2. Search → S3
3. Create Bucket
4. Unique name + Region select
5. Default settings → Create

✔ Bucket successfully created

---

 🔐 4. Permissions, Policies & Access Control

 🔹 ACL (Access Control List)

 Basic permission system
 Object / bucket level access

 🔹 Bucket Policy (JSON)

 Advanced access control
 Public access, IP based access, user based access
 JSON format me likhi jati hai

---

 🧾 5. JSON Policy (Understanding)

 ✅ JSON kya hai?

JavaScript Object Notation – ek data format jo policies likhne ke liye use hota hai.

 🧠 Use in S3

 Kaun access karega
 Kaunse actions allowed hain (GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject)

---

 🔁 6. Bucket Versioning

 ✅ Definition

Versioning ON karne par:
👉 File update replace nahi hoti,
👉 New version create hota hai
👉 Old versions safe rehte hain

 🎯 Use:

 Accidental delete se recovery
 Data protection
 Replication ke liye mandatory

---

 🔄 7. Lifecycle Rules

 ✅ Definition

Lifecycle policy automatically:

 Data ko cheaper storage me move karti hai
 Old data delete karti hai

 🧠 Example

 30 days → Standard-IA
 90 days → Glacier
 365 days → Delete

✔ Cost optimization

---

 ❄️ 8. Storage Classes

| Class                | Use                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| S3 Standard          | Frequently accessed data |
| Intelligent-Tiering  | Unknown access pattern   |
| Standard-IA          | Infrequent access        |
| One Zone-IA          | Single AZ backup         |
| Glacier              | Archival storage         |
| Glacier Deep Archive | Long-term archive        |

---

 🔁 9. S3 Replication

 Types:

 SRR → Same Region
 CRR → Cross Region

 Important:

✔ Replication = Asynchronous
✔ Versioning must be Enabled

 Use:

 Disaster recovery
 Compliance
 Global access

---

 🚀 10. Transfer Acceleration & CDN

 🔹 Transfer Acceleration

 Edge locations use karke fast upload/download
 Global users ke liye

 🔹 CDN (CloudFront)

 Content nearest location se deliver hota hai
 Faster website & streaming

---

 ❄️ 11. Amazon S3 Glacier

 ✅ Definition

Low-cost archival storage for:

 Rarely accessed data
 Long-term backups
 Legal / audit records

 Retrieval:

 Minutes to hours
 But very cheap storage

---

 💻 12. AWS CLI with S3

 Use:

 Upload
 Download
 Delete
 Automation

CLI → Faster than console for bulk work

---

 🔒 13. Security Features

✔ Bucket Policies
✔ IAM Roles
✔ Public Access Block
✔ Encryption (Server-side / Client-side)
✔ MFA Delete

---

 🧠 14. What I Practiced (Hands-On)

✔ Bucket creation
✔ File upload & download
✔ Permissions & policies
✔ Public & private access
✔ Versioning enable
✔ Lifecycle rules
✔ Storage class transition
✔ Replication setup
✔ Transfer acceleration
✔ Glacier understanding
✔ CLI basics

---

 🏁 DAY 13 CONCLUSION

👉 I now have end-to-end understanding of Amazon S3
👉 From basic storage → security → cost optimization → replication → archival
👉 With complete hands-on practice

---

 📌 One-Line Summary (Revision)

> Amazon S3 is a secure, scalable, cost-optimized object storage service that supports versioning, lifecycle automation, replication, CDN acceleration, and archival through Glacier.
