 🌐 1. How the Internet Works (Simple Explanation)

 Client–Server Model

 Client: Jo device request bhejti hai (mobile, laptop, browser).
 Server: Jo request ka answer deta hai (website ka computer).
 Example:

   Client → “Give me google.com page”
   Server → “Here is the page.”

 Process (Step-by-step):

1. User browser me URL type karta hai.
2. Browser server ko request bhejta hai (using HTTP/HTTPS).
3. Server request receive karta hai.
4. Server response bhejkar data return karta hai (website, image, video, etc.).
5. Browser data ko screen par show kar deta hai.

 GitHub

 Online platform (cloud-based) where Git repositories are stored.
 Allows:

   Hosting code
   Collaboration
   Sharing work
   Working on different projects

 Difference

| Git                        | GitHub                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Installed on your computer | Website/Cloud service   |
| Version control tool       | Storage & collaboration |
| Works offline              | Works online            |
| Commands needed            | UI + Git integration    |
